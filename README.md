This is a fan project of the popular game "Good pizza great pizza" made by Tapblaze. This projects aims to imagine the game in a 3D space and attemps to implement every feature of the original game onto this new imagined 3D space.

[P.S, I am not going to monitize this game whatsoever for obvious reasons.]
[P.S, Please don't sue me.]
